- Guess I never finished the original readme, anyway this is just a note
- Having issues with chunk_length in the downloads, the traces aren't the correct length, checking to see if I accidentally interpolated on original and not the copied data by re-downloading
- Changing /waveforms to /waveforms_wrong_length? and trying in a fresh directory
