Note: Not going to be working a full week, waiting on Lexie's PIV card so she can get her computer. This hopefully happens today (6/22) or tomorrow, and then we will be driving back to Eugene the rest of the week.


Goals:

Finished reading all code and taking notes

Read GMPE papers, and papers from Eric

Check out Chuck Langston's MATLAB codes for wavelet denoising, as well as Brad Aagaard's stuff
